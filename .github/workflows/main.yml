# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# 设置 GITHUB_TOKEN 的权限，以允许部署到 GitHub Pages
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

# 只允许同时进行一次部署，跳过正在运行和最新队列之间的运行队列
# 但是，不要取消正在进行的运行，因为我们希望允许这些生产部署完成
concurrency:
  group: pages
  cancel-in-progress: false

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
